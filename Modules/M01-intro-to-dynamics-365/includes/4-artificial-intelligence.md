Artificial intelligence (AI) is a set of algorithms that computers use to analyze data and make a conclusion. In some situations, the AI can train itself. The AI can arrive at a conclusion that's based on available data. In other situations, you can train the AI continually with repeated feedback and fine-tuning. The more data the computer has, the more it can make discrete or fine-tuned assumptions. You can then act on those assumptions and conclusions, or you can edit further.

The following image shows how AI runs on Microsoft Dataverse to support Dynamics 365.

Another way of looking at AI is through reasoning, understanding, and interacting:

* **Reasoning:** AI takes lot of data and adds logic so that you can understand and make decisions based on that data. For example, given performance data, AI could learn to find warning signs that a piece of equipment is likely to fail. AI continues to learn and become more accurate over time as you keep feeding it more data.
* **Understanding:** AI enables us to understand and interpret the data of our environment and our world. For example, it helps us find the meaning of text, speech, and images.
* **Interacting:** AI extends human ingenuity and lowers barriers between humans and machines. It allows machines to communicate with humans in a more natural way by recognizing human speech patterns.

When you verbally ask your phone to set a morning alarm, you're using AI.

In the phone example, AI is using natural language understanding. From your speech, the computer understands what you are trying to do and acts. You phone confirms the time you want to wake up and then configures the alarm.

In the streaming service example, AI is using machine learning. The streaming service bases the movie suggestion on your viewing history and all the variables that might influence the suggestion including:

- The type of movie.
- The actors.
- How you rated similar movies.
- What other viewers with a similar movie-viewing experience watch next.
- What you choose not to watch.

In both these cases, the computation that takes place is too complex for a simple set of algorithms.

Every organization can take advantage of pre-built AI services to bring more knowledge to each employee. You can also take advantage of a conversational AI platform with pre-built AI services to power digital agents and bring knowledge to customers. When optimizing business processes with AI, you can use packaged source solutions or create a custom AI solution. When bringing AI to every employee, you need to understand both how employees consume AI, and how new AI models have the potential to turn all employees into data scientists.

**AI Builder** gives everyone in your organization—whatever their technical experience—the ability to add AI capabilities to the apps they create and use. The no code/low code AI is part of the Microsoft Power Platform and requires using the Dataverse.

### AI in Dynamics 365

By using the Dynamics 365 AI, businesses get in-depth insights and can make each touchpoint more relevant and responsive with data-driven insights into customer needs and behaviors.

In Dynamics 365 Commerce, Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection uses AI to protect your e-commerce business—and your customers—against fraud. This protection helps drive down costs, achieve higher revenue, and improve your customers’ shopping experience.
