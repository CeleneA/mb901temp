How can business leaders make good decisions without insights into the underlying financial and operational data? With no visibility, it would be impossible! By using the reporting and analytics capabilities in Dynamics 365, you give every business user the insights they need.

To understand how an organization can connect its data and analyze, act on, or automate that data, you'll learn about Power Platform. Power Platform is a low-code platform that spans across Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and standalone applications. Power Platform is the foundation of several Dynamics 365 apps. We call these Dynamics 365 apps first-party apps and they are built as model-driven Power Apps on Power Platform including:

* Dynamics 365 Sales
* Dynamics 365 Marketing
* Dynamics 365 Customer Service
* Dynamics 365 Field Service      

You can use these apps as-is, or customized and extended using Power Platform. Clever business users—called citizen developers—can build and customize their own applications using the same platform that the first-party apps use. When you build your own apps using Power Platform, your apps are peers to the Microsoft first-party apps. This situation means you develop your apps with the same build tools, automation options, reporting, and more.

Microsoft Power Platform is more than the sum of its parts. Connect them together—and to Office 365, Dynamics 365, Azure, and hundreds of other apps—and build complete business solutions.
