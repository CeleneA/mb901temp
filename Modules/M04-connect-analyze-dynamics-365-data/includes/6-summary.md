In this module, we reviewed the ways that using the Power Platform can automate, connect, store, manage, and report on your data. First, we looked at Power Automate, which allows you to model business processes and automate workflows and your apps and services. We discussed the Common Data Model, which is a unified, intelligent, and enhanced standard that defines a common language for business entities. Next, we reviewed the Power Platform and how this low-code platform combines the use of Dynamics 365 applications. We built Power Platform on the Microsoft Dataverse, which manages your data to support interconnected business applications and processes. Finally, we reviewed the built-in reporting options available with Dynamics 365 apps, including views, charts, and dashboards and the 22 default financial reports in Finance and Operations applications.

The following graphic shows the Power Platform apps and supporting services.
