Dynamics 365 Human Resources helps you:

- Motivate employees to enrich their careers.
- Guide them to complete required training.
- Suggest professional development resources to drive future success.

You can use competencies in Dynamics 365 Human Resources to compare the skills, knowledge, or abilities defined for a job with the skills, knowledge, and abilities that employees have already obtained. You can track employees’ certificates, tests they've taken, and education they’ve completed. You can also examine current and future strategic needs, to help your employees shape their own objectives, and then find the training they need to develop the required competencies.

To help your employees reach their career goals, you can set up goals, create performance reviews, and track feedback. To help employees develop needed skills, you can also set up instructors, course types, courses, course descriptions, agendas, tracks, and sessions before you assign an instructor to a course, or register someone for a course. Instructors must already exist as employees, applicants, or contacts.

You use the employee development workspace to set the broader goals and competencies for the entire business. You can design and share performance review templates across the organization. You can also gain a complete view of skills data across the organization that help you plan and make more informed decisions faster.

Rich, interactive analytics make it easy to find skills gaps and address them by creating learning courses designed to close those gaps.

You can design and administer questionnaires to gather information. When a questionnaire is ready, you distribute it broadly or to a specific set of respondents to complete. After the respondents supply their answers, you can review and analyze the results.

The performance management process lets employees document and discuss their performance with their manager. In turn, managers can then give feedback and guidance to employees.
