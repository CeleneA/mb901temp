## Organization management

You can structure your organization using elements such as departments, jobs, and positions. These elements are among the foundational elements that you'll configure. You assign individual employees to positions, which in turn are associated with jobs.

Positions are an essential element of the lower level of an organization hierarchy. A position is an individual instance of a job. For example, the position sales manager—east is one of the positions that is associated with the job, sales manager. A position exists in a department and may have only one worker associated with it.

- When you assign an employee to a position that reports to another position, you create a direct reporting relationship between the employees who are assigned to the two positions.
- If your organization uses a matrix hierarchy, as a manager you can set up position hierarchy types and then add reporting relationships to positions for each hierarchy type that you set up.
- Managers can transfer an employee for full-time employment or for contractual employment. The transfer can shift an employee to a different division, position, or change the employment terms like basic pay.
