When you are in the field, you need specific information and items to service your customers effectively. Something as simple as not having the right part, or not knowing what was fixed in the past, can have a significant effect on your ability to resolve your customer's issue. We designed the Dynamics 365 Field Service mobile application with that thought in mind. The mobile app ensures that you have what you need when you need it. Whether working with your schedule, accessing customer data, or managing time-off, the access is available to you through the mobile application.
