You learned that with Dynamics 365 Field Service you can:

* Monitor your customer’s IoT connected assets and interact with those devices remotely with **Dynamics 365 Field Service**. 
* Use the tools available in **Universal Resource Scheduling** like the schedule board and the schedule assistant to find and schedule the most qualified resource to work on the item.
* Take advantage of **Resource Scheduling Optimization** to manage the automated scheduling of resources in different scenarios, or to run simulations to determine which option is best before applying it.
* Use the **Field Service mobile application** to access your scheduled work orders and complete the tasks associated with them such as installing products by using integrated tools.
* Use **mixed reality applications** such as Dynamics 365 Remote Assist and Dynamics 365 Guides to build 3D service and training solutions that can make you more effective in the field.
