The work orders you assign to technicians can affect your profitability. For example, let’s say that there's a work order on the south end of town. It will likely be more expensive to send a technician currently working on the north side than if you would send a technician on the south end of town. Situations like this one can be hard for individual dispatchers to manage. In these instances, you can turn to automated scheduling solutions to manage these scenarios effectively. Automated scheduling solutions allow you to focus your attention on managing the scheduling anomalies that occur throughout the day.

**Resource Scheduling Optimization (RSO)** is an add-on capability for Dynamics 365 Field Service. It allows you to schedule work orders for the most appropriate resources automatically. You can optimize bookings to minimize travel time and maximize working hours and more. RSO makes decisions based on your configured objectives, such as minimize travel time and maximize working hours.

The benefits of using Resource Scheduling Optimization include:

* **Automated scheduling:** You can schedule most requirements automatically to save time and allow you to focus on exceptions and billing.
* **Achieve scale:** You can manage more resources, enabling you to increase the resources you manage. 
* **Customer satisfaction:** Improved efficiency drives predictable arrival and completion times, and seamlessly schedules alternate technicians for urgent situations.
* **Technician efficiencies and reduced cost:** You can fit more appointments into working hours increasing revenue and reducing overtime costs. You also match work orders to technician skillsets reducing the cost of lost appointments.
* **Reduced fuel consumption and less vehicle maintenance:** You can give technicians turn-by-turn directions ensuring they take the shortest possible route, reducing fuel consumption and wear and tear on your vehicles. If each technician saves one tank of gas a month, the savings will surpass the cost of RSO. 
* **Improved customer retention:** You can avoid service level agreement (SLA) penalties and meet customer service commitments by giving preference to higher-priority work orders.
 
With RSO, you can manage different scheduling needs and desired outcomes including:

* **Overnight scheduling:** Overnight scheduling involves creating an optimization schedule that runs in the evenings or after hours. After hours jobs involve more information, such optimizing resources, requirements, and bookings for the next day or in some cases the following week. 
* **Intraday scheduling:** You can use intraday scheduling to schedule or optimize items as the day progresses. It involves creating a schedule that runs multiple times during a day, such as every hour. You can use this scenario to schedule new, high-priority items. 
* **Condition-based scheduling:** Condition-based scheduling doesn't take advantage of predefined schedules. You schedule new items or modify existing items based on defined conditions. For example, you can schedule emergency items right away. 
* **Cancelation and delays:** You use cancelation and delays when it will affect one individual resource. You can optimize the schedule for specific resources as needed for time frames that they specify. 
* **Simulations:** Simulations let you run jobs in a simulated manner to evaluate the results before you commit them to the schedule. If you like the schedule, you can choose to apply the simulation. 
 
You can use RSO's schedule board to filter resources and build multiple scenarios. You can find available resources and map them to recently scheduled items. Through it all, you can filter and call out resource identification to ensure that you schedule work items in the most efficient way with the required resources.

RSO allows you to manage how the system assigns work orders and schedules resources automatically. You define the specific objectives such as maximizing agent work hours.

As you learned in the video, with RSO you can manage automated scheduling of resources during overnight hours to ensure that items are ready to go in the morning, and you can take advantage of RSO's features during the day as new items are created. 

As you schedule work items, you can manage constraints and issues as they arise including:

- Optimize scheduling.
- Creating emergency work orders.
- Dealing with cancellations and delays.

Now let's turn our attention to Field Service Mobile.
