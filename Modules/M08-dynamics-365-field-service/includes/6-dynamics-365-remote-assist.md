When you are on-site, you may encounter scenarios that are outside of your comfort zone, or you could use help. Many times, this type of situation requires a second visit with a different technician who has more experience. This second visit reduces your first-time resolution rate and may have a negative effect on your customer's overall satisfaction. 

With Dynamics 365 Remote Assist, you can work more efficiently. You can connect with subject matter experts (SMEs) from different locations, solving the problem in real time. The SMEs can see what you are seeing and advise you on how to resolve the issue. You can also stay hands free to ensure that you can follow their recommended steps and procedures.

Dynamics 365 Remote Assist connects you with SMEs with critical information from items like work orders. You can solve problems in real time quickly. Just a few years ago this type of collaboration would have required additional resources.
