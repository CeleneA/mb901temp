In this digital world, managing a business is about collecting and managing data. Let's assume your customer data is stored your Dynamics 365 Sales instance. You also have data flowing in from your Internet of Things (IoT) devices, which you store in your Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management instance. You want to use this data to improve your business and create digital feedback loops. That means you need a way to have the data interact, a way to integrate the data across your Dynamics 365 applications.

You want to import data from Dynamics 365 Finance via Excel. Or you want to extend the functionality of one of the Finance and Operations apps using a third-party product.

Organizations using large enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems often find that it can be challenging to manage data effectively. This situation is especially true when with distributed data.

With the Finance and Operations apps, you can use the integration scenario that is right for you. The Finance and Operations apps make it easy to integrate with Office 365 and third-party apps. You can use the data management framework for data migration and management scenarios or use native Excel integration.
