You have customers, and customers need support. With a customer self-service portal, your customers can sign into their account to create and monitor their support cases. You’ll get fewer emails and calls from individuals looking for updates, and you can capture better targeted data about a case.

A customer self-service portal is an additional way for your customers to interact with your agents. The knowledge base, for instance, allows your customers to search for product support and documentation. With infused intelligence, Dynamics 365 Customer Service portals can show customers knowledge base articles based on previously entered keywords. You can also direct your customers to forums, where they can engage with their peers who have similar interests or issues. When help is needed, they can submit new cases from the portal.
