As your agents work with customers, it is important that they have the necessary data they need, accessible directly in the customer's record. This information includes data like open cases or active service contracts. Past communication with the customer is also available and your agents can generate new communication as needed. 

Dynamics 365 Customer Service has multiple components on the account form you engage with and service an account.

* **Timeline:** The timeline aggregates all interactions (activities, notes, and posts) directly in the account form. Agents can see relevant communication from a single point. They can take additional actions, such as:
    - Managing and closing open activities from within the timeline.
    - Adding new activities such as phone calls to the account directly from the timeline.
    - Capturing notes within the timeline.
* **Related Section:** You can see associated records from multiple related entities in a single location.

By taking advantage of configuration tools available in Microsoft Dataverse, you can tailor the account form to include relevant service data—rollup fields that display the total number of open cases for an account, for example.

As you learned in the video, important service data such as active cases, service contracts, and key customer contacts are available to agents directly from an account record.

Account records offer easy access to the information that is key to ensuring that your agents provide customers with the best level of support possible. Important information is available to agents from a single location. Items like rollup fields provide a quick visual summary of data, such as the total number of active cases for the account. Dynamics 365 Customer Service simplifies how your agents access the data and enhances agent productivity and effectiveness. 

Now let's turn our attention to case management.
