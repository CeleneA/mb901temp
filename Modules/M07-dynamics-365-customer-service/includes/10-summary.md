Dynamics 365 Customer Service allows you to deliver complete omnichannel customer service, including self-service, assisted service, and onsite service. These features are a competitive requirement if you want to maintain and support your customers successfully. However, the role of customer service continues to evolve. You may choose to sell services in addition to providing core break-fix support. You'll want to ensure that you have the technology to support your goals.
