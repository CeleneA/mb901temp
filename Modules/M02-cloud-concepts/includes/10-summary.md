Microsoft is a leading global provider of cloud computing services for businesses of all sizes. Microsoftâ€™s cloud computing is flexible and cost-efficient, which can be beneficial to every business, whether it's a small start-up or a large enterprise.

The cloud provider is responsible for the physical hardware required to execute your work, and for keeping it up to date. The computing services offered tend to vary by cloud provider. However, typically they include:

- Compute power
- Storage
- Networking
- Analytics

Microsoft provides a subscription-based model, so you can access Dynamics 365 via the cloud, without having to invest further in your IT network hardware and software licensing. 

The following are different types of cloud services: 

- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS).
- Platform as a service (PaaS).
- Serverless computing, overlapping with PaaS.
- Software as a service (SaaS).

Azure DevOps is a suite of services that provides an end-to-end tool chain throughout the application lifecycle from planning to deploying your application. It enables you to build, test, and deploy any application to any cloud or on- premises.

Dynamics 365 Lifecycle Services (LCS) is the central repository for most of the tools to prepare and deploy a project for Dynamics 365 Finance and Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management.

LCS is a collaborative workspace that customers and their partners can use to manage Finance or Supply Chain Management projects, from pre-sales to implementation to production. LCS provides checklists and tools that help you manage the project, including pre-built methodologies to help with implementation.
