There are three different ways to deploy cloud services: on a public cloud, private cloud, or hybrid cloud.

### Public cloud

Third-party cloud service providers own and operate public clouds, which deliver their computing resources, like servers and storage, over the internet. Microsoft Azure is an example of a public cloud. With a public cloud, all hardware, software, and other supporting infrastructure are owned and managed by the cloud provider. You access these services and manage your account using a web browser.

This model is the most common deployment model. In this case, you have no local hardware to manage or keep up to date—everything runs on your cloud provider's hardware. In some cases, you can save additional costs by sharing computing resources with other cloud users.

Public cloud offers the following advantages: 

* High scalability, which means you don't have to buy a new server to scale.
* Pay-as-you-go pricing; you pay only for what you use.
* You're not responsible for maintenance or updates of the hardware.
* You can take advantage of the skills and expertise of the cloud provider to ensure workloads are secure, safe, and highly available. 

Not all scenarios fit the public cloud. Here are some disadvantages to think about:

* There may be specific security requirements that can't be met by using a public cloud.
* There may be government policies, industry standards, or legal requirements that public clouds can't meet.
* You don't own the hardware or services and can't manage them as you may want.
* Unique business requirements, such as having to maintain a legacy application, might be hard to meet.

 ### Private cloud

A private cloud refers to cloud computing resources used exclusively by a single business or organization. A private cloud can be physically located in the company’s on-site datacenter. Some companies also pay third-party service providers to host their private cloud. A private cloud is one in which the services and infrastructure are maintained on a private network.

In a private cloud, you create a cloud environment in your own datacenter and provide self-service access to compute resources to users in your organization. Private cloud offers a simulation of a public cloud to your users, but you remain responsible for the purchase and maintenance of the hardware and software services.

This approach has several advantages:

* You can ensure the configuration can support any scenario or legacy application.
* You have control and responsibility over security.
* Private clouds can meet strict security, compliance, or legal requirements.

Some reasons teams move away from a private cloud are:

* You have some initial costs and must purchase the hardware for startup and maintenance.
* Owning the equipment limits the agility to scale as you must buy, install, and setup new hardware.
* Private clouds require IT skills and expertise.

 ### Hybrid cloud

Hybrid clouds combine public and private clouds, bound together by the technology that allows them to share data and applications. The hybrid cloud gives your business greater flexibility, more deployment options, and helps optimize your existing infrastructure, security, and compliance.

Hybrid clouds are helpful when you have things that can't be put in the cloud, maybe for legal reasons. For example, you may have some specific pieces of data—such as medical data—that can't be exposed publicly and need to be held in your private datacenter. Another example is one or more applications that run on old hardware that can't be updated. In this case, you can keep the old system running locally, and connect it to the public cloud for authorization or storage.

Some advantages of a hybrid cloud are:

* You can keep any systems running and accessible that use out-of-date hardware or an out-of-date operating system.
* You have flexibility with what you run locally versus in the cloud.
* You can take advantage of economies of scale from public cloud providers for services and resources and supplement with your own equipment when appropriate.
* You can use your own equipment to meet security, compliance, or legacy scenarios where you need to completely control the environment.

Some concerns you'll need to watch out for are:

* It can be more expensive than selecting one deployment model since it involves some cost up front.
* It can be more complicated to set up and manage.

Now let's turn our focus to cloud deployment.
