Cloud providers are also responsible for ensuring the safety and security of your data. As companies rapidly shift from on-premises technology infrastructure to cloud computing, legal and compliance professionals find themselves facing new questions from their organizations:

- Can we move to the cloud in our industry?
- What are the compliance requirements?
- What industry security standards do we need to think about?
- What should we look out for in our cloud services contract?

These questions are just some of the questions that today's legal and compliance professionals must master and explain to their boards.

Through its long-standing relationship with the legal and compliance community, Microsoft has developed a wealth of resources on the key regulatory and compliance considerations associated with cloud computing. We took advantage of this wealth of resources to build the trusted cloud.

The trusted cloud is built on four foundational principles: 
- **Security**: Protecting you from external cyberthreats. Microsoft's comprehensive approach to security helps protect your data wherever it may be—in a data center, on a phone, on a desktop, or in transit through the internet.
- **Privacy**: Giving you control over access to your data. Microsoft invests heavily in technology development and practices to ensure your privacy is actively protected. Microsoft provides the necessary tools to control both the privacy and administrative aspects of the data you put in the Microsoft cloud.
- **Compliance**: Unparalleled investment in meeting global standards. Microsoft is  adopting new certifications and partnering with regulators and standards bodies proactively to develop new regulations and standards when identifying opportunities to increase digital privacy and safety.
- **Transparency**: Clear insight into our policies and procedures. Microsoft is working tirelessly to increase its own transparency and the transparency of the industry and its regulators. Microsoft submits to third-party audits, publishes reports detailing government requests for customer data, and notifies individual customers when possible.

Let’s review cloud computing and see how it can benefit you.
