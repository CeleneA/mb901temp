When managing an event, it's often difficult to keep track of disconnected records and resources. Dynamics 365 Marketing changes that situation. It creates a single-data-silo location for event management integrated into sales and marketing business processes. You manage and process all the event details through the same portal location, resulting in an integrated event management process. 

To get started planning an event with Dynamics 365 Marketing, you create an event record. The event record has all your planning details, includes links to related records, and gives you a business-process timeline. The timeline guides you through each step of the event-planning process.

Once you have an event record, you set up your event team, manage speakers and sessions, set up event passes, and set up a venue. You control every aspect of the event, from the initial planning and budgeting, through promotion and publication, to attendee registration and final analytics. 

Dynamics 365 Marketing event management lets you:

* **Design the right event:** The event designer lets you create an event based on your organization's goals and factors such as the intended audience, type of event, and desired business outcomes. 
    -    You can track and measure event logistics, such as location details and fees, as you build the event. 
* **Create the right agenda:** You define every session offered throughout the event including tracking details such as session location, type of session, target audience, and who will be delivering the session. 
    -    You can add sessions to event tracks to make it easy for attendees to find sessions that are most important to them. 
* **Manage speakers and sponsors:** You can keep track of the individuals and organizations that are helping to make your event happen. 
    -    You can track details such as speaker sessions, individual or organization bios, and manage costs and expenses related to them. 
* **Manage registrations:** You can manage who is planning on attending your event. You can create event passes and packages to provide the best experience possible for your attendees. 
    -    You can evaluate sessions popularity and use that information to help dictate future offerings. 
* **Improve event experience:** You can manage and publish changes to sessions, tracks, and speakers directly to the event website. 
* **Drive sales activities:** You can use attendance information from participants in marketing campaigns to generate leads and help drive future revenue.
