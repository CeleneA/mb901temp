Dynamics 365 Sales helps salespeople:

- Build strong relationships with their customers.
- Take actions based on insights.
- Close sales faster. 

With Dynamics 365, you can move beyond disconnected data to gain real, measurable business value. Realizing business value with Dynamics 365 Sales begins by breaking down data silos to create unified relationship data across Dynamics 365, LinkedIn, and Office.

With Dynamics 365 Sales artificial intelligence (AI), you can use powerful prebuilt AI to derive value from your unified relationship data. You can also adapt the AI for your specific needs. The AI augments your ability to prospect and engage productively. It finds the highest potential prospects and opportunities and specific actions to move relationships forward. It does so by automating time-consuming, repetitive administrative work to free up your sellersâ€™ time. The performance insights also allow sales managers to deliver data-driven coaching and decision making.

Dynamics 365 Sales:

- Keeps track of your accounts and contacts.
- Nurtures your sales from lead to order.
- Creates sales collateral.
- Create marketing lists and campaigns.
- Follow service cases associated with specific accounts or opportunities.
