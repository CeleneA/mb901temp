In a digital sales environment, it's important for you to reduce distractions and stay on top of your priorities. Relationships have always been key to winning in sales. In the past, you focused on knowing the customer and building authentic one-on-one relationships. Problems arise when there are disparate systems that you must navigate to get the information and insights you need to build strong relationships.

When crucial data about relationships and accounts is in silos—CRM systems, social networks like LinkedIn, and productivity and email systems—it’s impossible to obtain meaningful and actionable insights for establishing and keeping strong customer relationships. You are overwhelmed with too much information and not enough insight. 

You understand the unique needs of your customer and focus on maintaining a high level of engagement with the buyer throughout the sales process. 

With the introduction of technology, organizations have experienced significant increases in productivity. In the pursuit of productivity, you have become removed from customers. Over time, you have shifted away from building relationships to executing transactions, at a time when customers expect more authentic and personal interactions. Always plugged in to mobile devices and social media, customers are more informed and have more power and influence. It’s no wonder customers today are more demanding, have higher expectations, and are less satisfied with the sales experience. 

With Dynamics 365 Sales, organizations can move beyond disconnected data to gain real, measurable business value including:

- **Data:** Realizing business value begins by breaking down data silos to create unified and complete relationship data across Dynamics 365, LinkedIn, and Office.
