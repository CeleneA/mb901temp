One of the consequences of living in the digital age is that we deal with a great deal of information. As a result, we're often short on attention and driven to distraction. Sellers must navigate data, processes, and tools, while making sense of conflicting or unclear expectations. 

The key considerations for delivering an intelligent sales and marketing solution include:

- Do your systems effectively engage with your customers?
- Do you think you need effective tools to send the right messages at the right time to your customers?
- Do you have a 360-degree view of your customer’s activities and insights?

Dynamics 365 Sales helps you modernize sales productivity and face the challenges of the digital age. It lets sellers work less and achieve more including: 

- Taking advantage of data-driven technologies to understand customer needs allowing sellers to build strong relationships with their customers, take actions based on insights, and close sales faster. 
- Keeping track of accounts and contacts, nurturing sales from lead to order, creating sales collateral, creating marketing lists and campaigns, and following service cases associated with specific accounts or opportunities.
- Helping sales managers take informed action and build better relationships with their customers. 

As a result, sellers can overcome the distractions and complexity to regain focus and sales momentum.

They can enhance key application scenarios by connecting the system of record with the LinkedIn data graph and insights. They can build custom applications powered by LinkedIn Sales Navigator intelligence, enhancing business processes with data about people, organizations, and relationships. Through personalized recommendations, sellers are given suggestions for the most relevant content to use in different instances based on what they're doing in the application.
