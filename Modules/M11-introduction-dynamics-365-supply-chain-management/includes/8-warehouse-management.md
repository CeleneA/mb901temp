With Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, it’s easy to process incoming purchase orders and streamline your inbound supply chain processes. You can optimize your outbound supply chain with automatic sales order release, efficient picking operations, and coordinated staging for shipment. With Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, it’s easier than ever to get products to customers quickly.

A work template defines the sequence of steps to get each item to the right staging location in the warehouse. With the warehousing mobile app, you can pick and place items quickly using any Android or Windows device. The solution supports both user-directed and system-directed picking. In this case, let’s use system-directed picking.

The warehousing mobile app is a powerful scanning solution for all inventory and warehouse operations. You can take advantage of advanced business intelligence on inbound receiving functions like counting, and on-hand precision and outbound shipping processes. Power BI analytics allows you to create custom reports from extensive capture data. Embedded strategies and guidance enable effective streamlining of picking procedures.

## Inbound scenario

For example, a shipment arrived at the warehouse. The vendor confirmed the delivery date, along with details about the shipped items. Using the warehousing mobile app, you can receive purchases from any handheld device quickly.

First, you enter the purchase order ID number, either by typing it or scanning it. Then you enter the quantity received for individual units or license plates (numbers assigned to each containment unit), and the system includes the conversion rate for reference. Using license plates to manage inventory reduces manual data entry and ensures efficient operations.

Next, you can use the app’s system-directed put-away capabilities for best warehouse placement. The solution determines the best put-away location based on flexible rules that consider item quantity, quality assurance requirements, and other customizable parameters. You can review the inventory status for the license plate as available, confirming that you received the purchase and put away.

## Outbound scenario

For example, to ensure efficient picking and shipping, the system grouped a sales order into a wave based on the order’s handling instructions and delivery requirements automatically. It determines which items need to be picked from where, based on rules that optimize the movement of goods.

First, you enter the license plate ID for the sales order, either by typing it, or scanning it. The system determines the best staging location to ensure the goods get to the customer quickly, by system-directed staging capabilities to load the items in the appropriate location for shipment. The system coordinates dock scheduling, so you know when and where to load the items for transport.
