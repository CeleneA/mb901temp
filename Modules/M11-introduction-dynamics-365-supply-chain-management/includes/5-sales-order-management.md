In the order-to-cash process, you receive orders via different methods, such as website, email, and telephone. You fulfill the orders through your logistics group. You can reserve the items before you pick, pack, and ship them to your customers. You invoice the orders and record the customer debts in the system. Your monitor the debts. When you receive the customer payments, you settle the payments and invoices.

Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management helps organizations optimize fulfillment and reduce costs by synchronizing logistics across sites, warehouses, and transportation modes. This synchronization allows you to respond to customer demand quickly by automating the coordination of order-to-cash processes.

Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management helps you choose delivery alternatives by combining all the relevant information in one interactive page.

Issuing a quotation closely matches the process for issuing a sales order. Most functionality found in the Sales order form is also available in the Sales quotation form. You convert quotations accepted by customers into sales orders. You can only confirm quotations created for a prospect when you convert the prospect to a customer.

Every sales order line transaction includes important data, such as unit numbers, pricing, delivery, and payment information. When you place an order, it must meet operational criteria. The criteria include quality checks, picking cycles, profit margins, bill of materials (BOM), formulas, and revisions.

Sales representatives create configuration models with embedded constraints. You can configure customer requirements and product attributes during the sales process. The model generates a list of required materials and routes automatically.

Customer returns are part of every business. Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management tracks every return and the reason, giving you vital insights to minimize future returns. Customers return items for many reasons. For example, an item might be defective, or it might not meet the customer's expectations. The return process starts when a customer issues a request to return an item. After you receive the customer's request, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management creates a return order.

By unifying processes from sales to fulfillment, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management connects sales and purchasing with logistics, production, and warehouse management for a 360-degree view of your supply chain. It helps you reduce procurement costs and gain greater control by automating procure-to-pay processes including:
