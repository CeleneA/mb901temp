The manufacturing industry has experienced a great deal of change recently:

- The use of mobile devices has increased.
- The cost of IoT sensors has decreased. 
- The scale of cloud-based platforms has increased.
- There have been significant advances in analytics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and mixed reality. 

These changes changed the manufacturing industry drastically. Customers are more knowledgeable, want more responsive experiences when buying and using products, and have more choices than ever before. For manufacturers, competitive edge is no longer based primarily on product offerings, but on the best and most profitable business models.
