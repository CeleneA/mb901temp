Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management includes asset management, which maximizes the life of your assets by managing assets and maintenance jobs.

Asset management lets you do all the tasks that are related to managing and servicing all the equipment in a company efficiently. This equipment includes machines, production equipment, and vehicles.

You can extend the life and performance of your equipment by using IoT and mixed reality to plan, predict, and complete asset maintenance.

Assets and work orders are central parts of asset management. An asset is a machine or machine part that requires continuous maintenance and service. You can create assets in a hierarchical structure, and you can relate them functional locations. You can plan maintenance jobs at all levels in the asset structure.
