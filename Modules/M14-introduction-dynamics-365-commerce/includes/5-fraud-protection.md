As a digital enterprise, you conduct business online and in real time. Although this approach helps you reduce costs and improve the customer experience, it also exposes you to serious threats of fraud. Sophisticated users take advantage of your online channel's relative anonymity and accessibility. For example, these users create transactions maliciously via compromised accounts and stolen payment instruments. Others try:

- Account takeover.
- Abuse of free trials.
- Fake product reviews.
- Warranty, refund, or reseller fraud.
- Abuse of program discounts. 

All these activities affect your profitability and reputation.

Some types of fraud even have profound consequences for society at large including money laundering and posting fake news.

Because online fraud is a substantial risk, it's likely that users can discover and exploit your vulnerabilities. Unlike during the early years of the internet, well-funded and well-equipped rings of professionals fund and orchestrate today's fraudulent transactions. Fraud protection professionals have the skills to fight this threat.

Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection focuses on payment fraud protection and related scenarios in e-commerce. It helps you:

- Drive down fraud loss.
- Increase bank acceptance rates to yield higher revenue.
- Improve the online shopping experience for its customers.
