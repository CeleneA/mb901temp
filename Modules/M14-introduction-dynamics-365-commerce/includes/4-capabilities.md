## Merchandising and inventory

Before you can offer products for sale in your retail channels, you create and configure the products in Dynamics 365 Commerce. To create the products, you define the product properties and attributes, and assign the products to retail category hierarchies. You make the products available to your retail channels and add them to an active assortment. Then you release the products to the legal entities where they're available.

You can also make price changes to products or set up discounts applied to items or transactions across your sales channels.

## Channel management

You decide how to define and configure your stores, which can be brick-and-mortar stores, online stores, or call centers. Each store can have its own payment methods, delivery methods, price groups, income and expense accounts, registers, and staff. 

After you create your store, you create an assortment of products that you want the store to carry. You can also define store-specific prices and discounts that apply to products that are available in the store.

## E-commerce

Dynamics 365 Commerce supports the management of catalogs, content, assets, promotions, inventory, and pricing across all channels. You can set up storefronts, manage content, and create catalogs of products for better sale experiences.

You can create layouts and templates with built-in web authoring and development tools. You can reuse rules and default content across a wide range of pages. You can then customize pages with themes and other page enhancements to give depth and richness to customer experience.

## Commerce deployment

Dynamics 365 Commerce gives you multiple options for package deployment. You can package separate packages for individual components, such as CPOS, store scale units, cloud scale units, and mobile considerations as a single retail deployable package.
