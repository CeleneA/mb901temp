In this module, we explored the role of security in Dynamics 365. This module included:

- Cloud security.
- Role-based security.
- Field level security.
- The functions of teams and business units as they relate to security. 

In cloud security, we learned about the layered approach to security in Dynamics 365 and Power Platform, including the use of encryption and authentication via Azure AD. We learned about data loss prevention policies and how they can prevent data leakage. Finally, we learned how to manage internal security within Dynamics 365 apps to streamline the user experience and protect data. 

The following process flow-chart shows how the system uses signals to verify every attempt to access apps and data.
