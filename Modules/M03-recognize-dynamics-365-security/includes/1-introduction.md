Dynamics 365 and Power Platform are built with security, privacy, compliance, and transparency in mind.  

Microsoft cloud security safeguards your cross-cloud resources. It helps secure infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS). It finds vulnerabilities in your apps to provide better defense.

In many cases, customers will be migrating from their own internal hosting of applications on-premises, where they controlled the infrastructure and security into the cloud.

In this module, you'll learn about data loss prevention, which is part of the overall layers of security that Dynamics 365 and Power Platform offer.
