Three main goals of a financial management system in any organization are:

* **Maximize profit:** Earning maximum profits in the short term and the long term depends on financial awareness. Dynamics 365 Finance keeps all financial transactions in a ledger and offers tools and features to provide insight into incurring costs and projected revenue so that you can make proper decisions.
    - The **general ledger** module is the core of Dynamics 365 Finance and we integrated it with other subledgers so each department can manage its own books without disrupting the general ledger.
    - The **cash and bank management** module allows you to manage your banks and balances and reconcile the bank statements with the general ledger.
* **Maximize wealth:** With Dynamics 365 Finance you can manage your cash flow, earn maximum wealth for your shareholders, and improve your organization's chances of success. Your organization must have a good cash flow to pay the daily expenses such as wages, rent, electricity bills, and more. Companies with a good cash flow can take advantage of opportunities such as getting cash discounts on purchases, making large-scale purchases, giving credit to customers, and more.
* **Operational consistency and efficiency:** Prompt month end closing, and correct reporting are imperative for overall operational health of your organization. These tasks are critical as you give the information to management and shareholders. Dynamics 365 Finance capabilities such as a shared chart of accounts across multiple legal entities and dashboards with a global view of an organization allow you to do more.

Dynamics 365 Finance’s tools, features, and workspace with built-in intelligent controls give you insights into your organization's cash flow, product supply, and demand. It can analyze customer demographics and costs of goods so that you can negotiate advantageous agreements with your vendors and customers.

* The **accounts payable** and **accounts receivable** modules offer you what you need to manage vendor and customer daily processes such as invoicing and generating or collecting payments.
* The **budgeting** module lets you estimate the total financial requirements properly by determining how much finance is necessary to operate and what the requirements are for fixed and working capital.
* The **sales and marketing, inventory management, procurement and sourcing, cost management**, and **cost control** modules in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management all contribute to making proper decisions to maximize the wealth of your organization.

The following graphic shows how the general ledger module interacts with other modules in the following scenarios:

* **Cash and bank management:** Dynamics 365 Finance records all incoming and outgoing funds in the general ledger. Each bank has a corresponding account in the general ledger chart of accounts. This module simplifies your ability to reconcile bank statements with financial management transactions in periodic processing.
* **Accounts payable:** Dynamics 365 Finance records all invoices and payment transactions in the general ledger. Your accounts payable clerks match the purchase order with the recorded invoice to determine if you should pay the vendor invoice. On the due date, Dynamics 365 Finance generates payments that affect the general ledger cash and bank management.

* **Project management and accounting:** In both time and materials and fixed price projects, you need to make purchases at specific times. The project management and accounting module can interact with the procurement and sourcing module in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management to generate purchase orders, which you settle in the accounts payable module in Dynamics 365 Finance.

During project implementation, you can create invoices for customers. Your sales department can continue managing the quotes and converting them to invoices for ongoing projects, alongside their typical role of marketing goods and managing sales. Then, you can manage customer payments in the accounts receivable module.
